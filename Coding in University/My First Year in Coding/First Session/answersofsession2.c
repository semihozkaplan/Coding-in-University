	double radius, area, circumf;
	int num_circ;
	char circ_name;





	/*Assignment 2 Answer*/ // wrongs:#include, int main() and you have to ask types of integers // 10

	int first;
	int second;           //3 point
	int third;
	printf("Enter three numbers please");      //3 point
	scanf_s("%d %d %d", &first, &second, &third); //4 point



/*Assignment 3 Answer*/ //right 15
	
	int n = 21;
	printf("The value of n is %d", num1);


/*Assignment 4 Answer*/ //wrongs:it should be double and you should calculate the statement // 10

	int sideone = 4; //5 point
		int area = 16;
		printf("The area of a square whose side length is %d cm is %d square cm", sideone, area); /5 point

/*Assignment 5 Answer*/ //wrongs:it should be 4 float but you did 3 float and your sentences miss and you has to write %f in printf function //15
